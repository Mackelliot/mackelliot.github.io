  <h2>About</h2>
  <img src="about.jpeg" alt="About Perk Up, Grant!">
  <p><strong>Perk Up, Grant!</strong> started the way many great ideas do‚Äîsomewhere after a fourth cup of coffee but before a fourth cup of wine. After rewatching all seasons of <em>Bluey</em> for the 9th time without any good next things to watch, a weary dad hit his limit. So, naturally, he did the only reasonable thing left: he opened a coffee shop in his house.</p>
  <p>What began as a small setup‚Äîjust him, a stubborn espresso machine, and a dream‚Äîquickly became a local favorite. But there was a cost. Mainly, he could no longer say ‚ÄúOh sorry, I don‚Äôt work here‚Äù when his in-laws asked him to unclog the sink.</p>
  <p>Today, Perk Up, Grant! isn‚Äôt just a place for coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs a place for connection. It‚Äôs about love, family, and the people who show up for each other. One cup at a time.</p>
